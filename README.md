## 🌟 What is SafeWalk?

**SafeWalk** is a **high-reliability personal safety application** designed for:

- 🚶 Late-night walks  
- 🚌 Daily commutes  
- 🌃 Solo travel  
- ⚠️ Emergency-prone situations  

Unlike traditional SOS apps that require **manual action during danger**,  
**SafeWalk works proactively**:

> ⏱️ Set a timer  
> ✅ Mark yourself safe  
> 🚨 Fail to check in → alerts are sent automatically  

Even if your phone is **lost, stolen, switched off, or destroyed**,  
SafeWalk still **notifies your guardians via the cloud**.
